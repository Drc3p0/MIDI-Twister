# MIDI Twister
 teensy code for the midi twister board that was created during a CETI hackathon weekend at PSU.  
The contact points were made using flat Cat6e cable and conductive copper adhesive-backed sheets, with a piece of foam in between so that the switch makes contact whenever it is pressed, and springs back to an open switch when not touched.
